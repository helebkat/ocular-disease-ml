# Ocular Disease Recognition using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for our DATA 602 group project

## Group Members:
- Mariia Vetluzhskikh (mvetlu@umd.edu)
- Helen Zichen Li (hli12349@umd.edu)
- Karthik Vakada (kvakada@umd.edu)
- Saransh Kumar (saranshk@umd.edu)
- Simi Shrivastava (simish98@umd.edu)

## Dataset
We are using the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k), originally collected by Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd and presented at the [odir2019.grand-challenge.org](https://odir2019.grand-challenge.org/). This dataset includes ophtalmological images and a CSV file with medical records

## Project Objectives
- Analyze a CSV file to extract hidden patterns and insights from tabular data
- Create a ML model for multi-class classification of ocular diseases
- Enhance diagnostic accuracy in ophthalmology using DL-based technology
